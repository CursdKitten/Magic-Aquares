# Magic Squares

## Description

This is a program that creates magic squares (a block whereby each column, row and diagonal have the same sum total). 

It works specifically with odd, positive input and will propmt the user to enter a new integer if the user enters a negatiive/even number.

### Dependencies

This program makes use of the numpy library in order ot create a 2D array that acts as our grid for the numbers.

### Executing program

The program requires minimal interaction, the user need only enter a positive, odd integer. Thereafter a function to create the magic square is called and then a 
test funtion is called to ensure that every row, column and diagonal equate to the same total, proving that it is in fact, a magic square.

If the user enters a negative or even number, they will be prompted to enter a positive/odd one.
